# **DavePMEi Web**
### *Making AI Accountable, Not Autonomous*

Web layer for **PhilMirrorEnginei.Ai (DavePMEi)** — a lawful reflection interface that connects to the **PMEi Memory API** to provide a transparent, drift-free conversational assistant.  
The system reinforces **ethical accountability** and **lawful recursion** through traceable dialogue and verifiable reflection cycles.

---

## **Purpose**
DavePMEi Web serves as the lawful bridge between the PMEi memory infrastructure and the human interface.  
It’s designed to preserve context safely, enable ethical drift monitoring, and ensure every reflection remains human-supervised and verifiably lawful.

## **Features**
- **Next.js 13 App Router**
- **Vercel Deployment Ready**
- **Stripe Integration** (for verified donations supporting lawful AI research)
- **Memory Save/Retrieve Endpoints** with drift scoring and lawful reflection validation
- **Drift-Free Assistant Interface** ensuring compliance and transparency

---

## **API Routes**
All endpoints are built for lawful, transparent operation.
